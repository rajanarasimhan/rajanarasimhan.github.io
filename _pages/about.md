I&#39;m sophomore student at BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa Campus studying Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I love learning about AI, especially computer vision. I&#39;m currently working on a project to classify malware by converting binary and asm codes to images.

**Hobbies**

I have always been lover of cars from childhood, love reading about them and probably spent half of my life watching car videos in YouTube and binge watching Top Gear and Grand Tour. I&#39;m soon planning to write car blog in my spare time. I also love playing and watching badminton, table tennis and football
