Created Web-App for Alzheimer Detection

- I was part of group involved in developing Web-App for Alzheimer Detection. We developed computer vision and machine learning models which can predict level of Dementia/Alzheimer in using MRI scan or Oasis-Data.
-User can upload image of MRI or give values based on Oasis-Data and Web-App will provide the level of Dementia/Alzheimer(Mild Demented, Very Mild Demented, Non Demented, Moderate Demented)
