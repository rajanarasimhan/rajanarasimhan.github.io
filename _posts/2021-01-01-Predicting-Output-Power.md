Here I got the dataset from UCI. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant. I used 50 fold Cross Validation with XGB and my RMSE was around 4 for the whole dataset
